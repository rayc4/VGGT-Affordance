1. **Carefully observe the coordinate location**:
   - Carefully examine the specific location of coordinates ({initial_coords['x']}, {initial_coords['y']}) in the image
   - Analyze whether this location actually contains an operable functional component
   - Consider whether this location is easily accessible for operation

2. **Verify operability**:
   - Confirm that the coordinates point to a genuine operable functional component (such as door handle, switch button, plug, etc.)
   - Check whether this location can actually be operated
   - Avoid pointing to decorative elements, background objects, or non-operable parts

3. **Consider alternative locations**:
   - If the current coordinates are not precise enough, provide more precise coordinates
   - Consider if there are better operable point locations
   - Ensure new coordinates point to the most direct and commonly used operable point

4. **Output result**:
   - If current coordinates are correct, output: "Coordinates are correct"
   - If adjustment is needed, output new coordinates in format: (x, y)

- Ensure coordinates point to actual operable functional components
- Consider object recognition under different angles and lighting conditions

Please follow these detailed steps for analysis:

1. **Comprehensive image observation**:
   - Carefully observe the overall layout and scene of the image
   - Identify all visible objects and devices in the image
   - Pay attention to image details, including object positions, sizes, shapes, etc.

2. **Identify the target object**:
   - Based on the action description, determine the specific object that needs to be operated
   - The target functional component is specifically: "{affordance_info}"
   - Focus your search on this exact functional component

3. **Precisely locate the target functional component**:
   - You are looking for: "{affordance_info}"
   - This could be:
     * Door handle, door lock, door latch (for doors)
     * Cabinet door handle, drawer handle (for cabinets)
     * Switch button, switch panel, switch lever (for switches)
     * Plug body, socket hole, power interface (for plugs)
     * Button center, button edge (for buttons)
     * Faucet switch, faucet handle (for faucets)
     * Drawer handle, drawer pull ring (for drawers)
     * Window handle, lock catch (for windows)
     * Power button, control panel, display screen (for appliances)
     * Pull handle, hinge, lock (for furniture)

4. **Detailed coordinate position analysis**:
   - Carefully estimate the precise pixel coordinates of the "{affordance_info}" in the image
   - Consider the image dimensions and proportions
   - Ensure coordinates point to the actual "{affordance_info}" component
   - Avoid pointing to decorative elements or approximate positions of entire objects
